0.6.0-8 | 2022-10-18 10:11:31 -0700

  * Adapted paraglob to compile with MSVC for windows environment. (Elad Solomon)

0.6.0-6 | 2022-10-06 08:58:47 -0700

  * clang-tidy: Fix a couple of minor issues (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

  * Fix a Coverity finding (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

    1491316: AUTO_CAUSES_COPY due to a for loop using auto& instead of const auto&

  * Mark some paraglob methods as const, fix some style issues (Tim Wojtulewicz, Corelight)

0.6.0-2 | 2021-04-21 14:02:25 -0700

  * Fix a stringop-truncation warning in mpool_strndup() (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    The previous version did not actually have a problem since it explicitly
    added a null-terminator after the strncpy(), but as expected by
    semantics/docs of mpool_strndup(), no usages seem to depend on the
    behavior of strncpy() over a straight memcpy(), so that is more
    appropriate and fixes the compiler warning.

  * Fix compiler warning about copying loop variable. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.5.0-4 | 2020-11-24 15:12:15 -0800

  * Rely on GNUInstallDirs for libdir selection (Christian Kreibich, Corelight)

    This allows libdir overrides to be inherited in Zeek-bundled installs.

0.5.0-2 | 2020-09-21 13:35:55 -0700

  * Avoid calling qsort() with null pointer argument (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Likely no ill-effects of doing so since number of elements was always
    observed to be zero whenever a null pointer was passed, but qsort() may
    technically be annotated with a `nonnull` attribute, so that triggers an
    error when using `-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute`.

0.5.0 | 2020-02-18 15:21:21 -0800

  * Release 0.5.0.

  * Increase max allowed time for benchmark test to increase
    reliability. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Set pattern ID type in AhoCorasickPlus::addPattern to avoid risk
    of invalid memory accesses. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

0.3-9 | 2020-01-03 12:03:22 -0700

  * Change AhoCorasickPlus::addPattern() to take a string_view (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix use-after-free bug

    The default assumption of AhoCorasick::addPattern() was that the memory
    used to store pattern strings is available for the entire lifetime of
    the process, but Paraglob initialization was passing in temporary
    std::string objects. (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

  * Fix btest.cfg PATH (Jon Siwek, Corelight)


0.3-5 | 2019-10-29 09:10:19 -0700

  * Switch to require C++17. (Robin Sommer, Corelight)

0.3 | 2019-09-30 21:07:37 -0700

  * Re-organize and install all paraglob header files (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Moves all paraglob headers into include/paraglob and installs them.
    Also shortened some filenames since they'll be included via paraglob
    subdirectory now, like "paraglob/paraglob.h".

    Moves ahocorasick headers into src/ since they're not part of the
    public API.

  * Forward declare AhoCorasickPlus in paraglob.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)

    Such that it becomes an implementation detail and no longer requires
    installation of ahocorasick headers along with paraglob's.

  * Remove empty paraglob.h (Jon Siwek, Corelight)
